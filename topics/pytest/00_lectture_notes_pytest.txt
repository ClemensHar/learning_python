pytest -v -s

## specify file name and testname to only execute certain files
pytest topics\pytest\test_login.py -vsk testLog

# grouping testcases
## custom markers: add markers to group test cases -> only run test which are marked with marker1
## predefined markers: pytest --markers --> shows predefined markers
